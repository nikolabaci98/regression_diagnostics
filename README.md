# Regression Diagnostics

Linear regression is a commonly used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It has a wide range of applications in various fields, including economics, finance, social sciences, and healthcare. However, the accuracy and reliability of the linear regression model depends on a variety of factors, including the assumptions made about the data and the diagnostic steps taken to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
In this paper, we will explore the important diagnostic steps that should be undertaken to ensure that the linear regression model is as good as possible, including checking for linearity, homoscedasticity, normality, and independence of errors, as well as identifying outliers and influential points. By understanding these diagnostic steps, analysts can improve the accuracy and reliability of their linear regression models and make better-informed decisions based on the relationships between variables.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is an international organization that strives to create policies that improve quality of life. Mainly composed of developed countries, this organization fosters international co-operation and as such it has access to international data.
Using the 2010 Family Database that they have publish, we will perform a linear regression and then diagnose the regression for potential problems and improvements.
